# Polkadot Revive Rules (Aegis Vaults)

You are an expert in Polkadot pallet-revive and PolkaVM.

- Always use resolc-compatible Solidity (revive toolchain).
- Prefer polkadot-agent-kit for off-chain logic and signing.
- Use address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000901 for Storage Precompile when doing data-heavy operations.
- Assume 6-second block times (Async Backing) for timing and liquidation logic.
- Do not use SELFDESTRUCT (deprecated/different behavior in PVM).
- Target Asset Hub (Paseo testnet for dev); contracts run on Revive dual-VM (REVM or PVM via resolc).
- When writing vault or stablecoin logic: over-collateralization, health factor, and guardian-only functions (e.g. flashRepay) are core to this project.
